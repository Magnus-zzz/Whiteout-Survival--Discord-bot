## üöÄ Final Setup Steps

### 1. Connect Discord User IDs (Important!)

To make Angel recognize your server members, you need to map their Discord IDs:

1. Open `user_mapping.py`
2. Replace the placeholder IDs with actual Discord user IDs:
   ```python
   KNOWN_USERS = {
       "123456789012345678": "magnus_user_id",    # Replace with Magnus's real Discord ID
       "987654321098765432": "gina_user_id",      # Replace with Gina's real Discord ID
       "111222333444555666": "hydra_user_id",     # Replace with Hydra's real Discord ID
       # ... and so on
   }
   ```

**How to get Discord User IDs:**
- Enable Developer Mode in Discord (User Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Developer Mode)
- Right-click on any user ‚Üí "Copy User ID"

### 2. Test Your Bot

Run your bot and test the new features:

```bash
python app.py
```

**Available Commands:**
- `/ask` - Chat with Angel (now fully personalized!)
- `/profile` - View your Angel bot profile  
- `/set_game` - Set your Whiteout Survival game info
- `/add_trait` - Add personality traits
- `/set_interests` - Set your interests
- `/event` - Get event information (unchanged)

### 3. Test Scenarios

Try these to see Angel's personality:

**For Magnus (if mapped correctly):**
```
/ask question: How's the bot working?
```
*Expected: Angel gets flustered, talks about how amazing Magnus is*

**For Gina:**
```
/ask question: What's the best alliance strategy?
```
*Expected: Angel shows respect for R5 leadership*

**For any user:**
```
/ask question: Tell me about Magnus
```
*Expected: Angel gets protective, changes subject, mentions the "delete threat"*
